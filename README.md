## 1)Abstract

Games offer an enjoyable and effective approach to learning math. By integrating game-based learning principles and digital tools, educators can create engaging environments that enhance student engagement, motivation, and conceptual understanding. Key elements include aligning game mechanics with math concepts, providing instant feedback, encouraging collaboration, and utilizing digital resources. This approach improves problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and mathematical reasoning. Incorporating games alongside traditional methods helps students develop math proficiency while fostering a growth mindset and self-confidence. Selecting appropriate games, aligning them with curriculum goals, and tracking progress through analytics are crucial for successful implementation. Embracing game-based learning revolutionizes math education, providing support to students in the digital era. So I have created a quiz game in which a student can easily learn concepts of mathematics.

## 2)Methodology

1) So in this game I have created a front page with some tranistions and an overview. Now when the child clicks on the Start button a new page comes displaying the actual game. Now in this game I have explained the instructions to be followed and how to play the game.
2) Now if a person drags all the numbers correctly and checks for the result a new page comes congratulating that person and a button redirecting the person to play again.
3) Now if a person drags the numbers incorrectly and checks for the result a new page comes explaining that the answer is incorrect a button redirecting the person to play again.
4) Suppose a person does not drags any value and checks for the answer a prompt comes redirecting the person to drag the values.

Tranisitions:
1) The first show page of the quiz game has some text transitions which looks appealing.
2) The actual game page has some css properties in which if a person is dragging the values in correct order then a green bar is visible below each element and if the order becomes incorrect then a red bar is visible below the element.
3) It will help the student to know if he is doing it correct or not.

This whole prject was made from scratch, used different javascript functions and concepts to achieve it.It's just a demo in which i have used the concept of function based components. By profession I am a React developer but as to make the code ore readable and understandable I simply used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hope you will like it!
